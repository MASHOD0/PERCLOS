# PERCLOS
**PERCLOS** is the __percentage of eyelid closure over the pupil over time__ and reflects slow eyelid closures ("droops") rather than blinks. A PERCLOS drowsiness metric was established in a 1994 driving simulator study as the proportion of time in a minute that the eyes are at least 80% closed.
